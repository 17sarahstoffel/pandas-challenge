This is my solution to homework #4 for data bootcamp

As an educator, I was very excited to do this activity and see the trends from the data frames. When you look at the scores by school spending per student you can see that the more money spent per student, the lower the scores and percentages. This was very interesting to me, you would think it would be the other way around. I went back to see if the Top Performing Schools table would show the same information, but in the budget per student column for the top five schools, their values covered all the spending ranges. If I would continue with this data I would try to look into what the money is going to and if that affects student scores.  Looking at the school scores by school size, the larger the school, the lower the scores and percentages. That was not too shocking for me. What I found interesting was how similar the small and middle schoolsâ€™ data were. I thought there would be some difference between the two. Using the trends from the scores by school size, helped me to make sense of the trends in the scores by school type data frame. Based on school type, charter schools tend to do better with their test scores and percentages. This makes sense to me since charter schools tend to be on the smaller side, while district schools tend to be on the larger side. This makes sense with previous trends I have seen in the data.
